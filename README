Integration for toggl
---------------------

Currently the only thing that this script does is to load in the data from
my local time tracker and import that into toggl.

Toggl actually has a CSV import, but we cannot use that for several reasons
- it is only available for administrator logins
- they expect you to use it to setup a new project, not to do ongoing imports

gtimelog2toggl
--------------

I want to be able to use my local (non cloud) time tracker and at regular
intervals export data from that into toggl, by creating new toggl time
records.

My local data has prefixes to indicate which items are intended for toggl.
I may wish to relatively inflate these times if there is a significant amount
of non toggl entries (need to check what the data looks like compared to our
intents)
I choose not to have the ability to edit old gtimelog entries and have the
changes reflected in toggl -- only new entries are to be created.
